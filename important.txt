Complaint Management:
1. User authentication with 1 admin user.
2. Accept complains from all users.
3. Allow admin (with special priveledges) to update the status of complaint from pending, to processing and complete.
4. The person who created the complaint should be finally able to close the complaint after resolution.
5. Make 2 different dashboards for normal users and resolving authorities.

===============================================================================

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
     For example:

       root to: "home#index"

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     For example:

       <p class="notice">< %= notice %></p>
       <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

  4. You can copy Devise views (for customization) to your app by running:

       rails g devise:views
