# RoR-ComplaintManagement

- After cloning, to run the application, type the following in a terminal opened at the root of it:

	```
	bundle install
	rake db:create
	rake db:migrate
	rails s
	```

	and you will be able to see the application in action.

## Objectives:

The objectives of this project are:

1. User authentication with 1 admin user.

2. Accept complaints from all users.

3. Allow admin (with special privileges) to update the status of complaint from pending, to processing and complete.

4. The person who created the complaint should be finally able to close the complaint after resolution.

5. Make 2 different dashboards for normal users and resolving authorities.

6. Now add validations to check if complaint title is not empty. As told it should do frontend as well as model validation.

7. Also modify the authentication to ask for name also while creating a account. You will have to add column in database and modify the controllers of devise also.

## Creating the application:

- Create the application with the name ComplaintManagement using the MySQL database with the command:

	`rails create new ComplaintManagement -d mysql`

- Navigate to the folder and then generate a scaffold to generate the MVC for the table with the resource name as Complaint, and three fields being the Name, Title and Details using:

	`rails g Complaint name:string title:string details:text`

- Change the default route of the application in `config/routes.rb`: 

	```ruby
	root "complaints#index"
	```

- For authentication, add the gem 'devise' to the `Gemfile`.

- Each time a gem is added, remember to execute

	`bundle install`

- Using devise, the model & views for the user are generated by:
	
	```
	rails generate devise User
	rake db:migrate
	rails generate devise:views
	```

- To authenticate users on opening any page of the application, add this filter to the Complaints controller (`controllers/complaint_controllers.rb`)

	```ruby
	before_action :authenticate_user!
	```

- Add the gems 'bootstrap-sass' & 'jquery-rails' to the `Gemfile` to generate a list of routes for easier modification.

- Modify the main HTML page, i.e. `app/layouts/application.html.erb` to display options for logging in and out, and account details:

	```html
	<!--...-->
	<body>
	  <header class="navbar navbar-fixed-top navbar-inverse">
	    <div class="container">
          <nav>
            <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
	          <li><%= link_to "Home",   root_path , class: "btn "%></li>
	          <% if user_signed_in? %>
	            <li><%= link_to "Account", edit_user_registration_path, class: "btn "  %></li>
	            <li>
	              <%= link_to('Logout', destroy_user_session_path, method: :delete) %>
	            </li>
	          <% else %>
	            <li><%= link_to "Sign Up", new_user_registration_path, class: "btn " %></li>
	            <li><%= link_to "Sign In", new_user_session_path, class: "btn " %></li>
	          <% end %>
	        </ul>
	      </nav>
	    </div>
	  </header>
	<!--...-->
	```

- To uniquely identify each user, perform the migration

	`rails generate migration add_column_user_id_to_complaints user_id:integer`

- To let a user associate with multiple complaints, modify the User model (`app/model/user.rb`) to include the line

	```ruby
	has_many :complaints
	```

- Each complaint is tied to a single user and is validated by adding these lines to the Complaint model:

	```ruby
	belongs_to :user
	validates_presence_of :user
	```

- Update the Complaint controller to show only the user's complaints in his dashboard (the Index):

	```ruby
	def index
	  @complaints = Complaint.where(:user_id => current_user.id)
	end
	```

- Associate each complaint with the user ID on creation in the Complaint controller method:

	```ruby
	def create
	  @complaint = Complaint.new(complaint_params)
	  @complaint.user_id = current_user.id
	  respond_to do |format|
	  #...
	end
	```

### Objective 1:

- Add a boolean attribute 'admin' to every user by first:
	
	* Generating the migration:

		`rails g migration add_column_admin_to_user admin:boolean`

	* Before migrating, modify the migration to set the default value of the 'admin' attribute as False:

		```ruby
		add_column :users, :admin, :boolean, default: false
		```

	* Then using the Rails console (`rails c`), set a particular user to be the Administrator (or Admin) by updating the attribute 'admin' to True:

		```
		user = User.first (or any user of your choice)
		user.admin = True
		user.save
		```

	If no user has been created already, do so and set it to be the Admin. 

	* To test if a user is an admin, use the method 

		```ruby
		current_user.try(:admin?)
		```

### Objective 2:

- The objective is implicitly achieved i.e. all users can make a complaint by default.

### Objective 3 & 4:

- First generate a migration to add an attribute 'status' to every complaint:
	
	`rails g migration add_column_status_to_complaint status:string`

- Modify the migration to set the default value of 'status' to "Pending", then perform the migration.
	
	```ruby
	add_column :complaints, :status, :string, default: 'Pending'
	```

- To check for the value of status, add these methods to the Complaint model:

	```ruby
	def processing?
	  status == "Processing"
  	end
  	def pending?
      status == "Pending"
  	end
  	def complete?
      status = "Complete"
  	end
  	```


- Define a new Complaint controller to update the status according to the specifications (using the PATCH method), and validate it against the user:

	```ruby
	def update_status
      new_status = @complaint.new_status(current_user)
      @complaint.update_attribute(:status, new_status)
	  redirect_to @complaint, notice: "Marked as " + new_status
    end
    ```

- Define a new function in the Complaint model to return the new status to update in the method above:

	```ruby
	def new_status(current_user)
	  new_status = status
	  if current_user.try(:admin?)
	    if pending?
	      new_status = 'Processing'
	    elsif processing?
	      new_status = 'Complete'
	    end
   	  elsif id == current_user.id && complete?
	    new_status = 'Resolved'
	  end
	  return new_status
	end
    ```

- To use the updated model and controller (also to differentiate between the User and Admin dashboards), edit the Index view (`index.html.erb`) to the following:

	```html
	<!--...-->
    <td><%= link_to 'Delete', edit_complaint_path(complaint) %></td>
    <!--...-->
    <% if current_user.try(:admin?) %>
      <% if complaint.pending? %>
        <td><%= link_to 'Mark as Processing', update_status_complaint_path(complaint), method: :patch %></td>
      <% elsif complaint.processing? %>
        <td><%= link_to 'Mark as Complete', update_status_complaint_path(complaint), method: :patch %></td>
      <% end %>
    <% else %>
      <% if complaint.pending? %>
        <td>Pending</td>
      <% elsif complaint.complete? %>
        <td><%= link_to 'Mark as Resolved', update_status_complaint_path(complaint), method: :patch %></td>
      <% end %>
    <% end %>
    <td><%= link_to 'Destroy', complaint, method: :delete, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %></td>
    <!--...-->
     ```

- Add the corresponding method in the `routes.rb` file:

	```ruby
	#...
	resources :complaints do
	  member do
		patch :update_status
	  end
	end
	#...
	```

### Objective 5:

- For different dashboards (i.e. identify users and the Admin seperately), modify the main application header (in `application.html.erb`) to match the following:

	```html
	<!--...-->
	<header class="navbar navbar-fixed-top navbar-inverse">
      <div class="container">
        <% if current_user.try(:admin?) %>
          ADMIN DASHBOARD
        <% elsif current_user %>
          <%= current_user.name %>'s dashboard
        <% end %>
        <nav>
    <!--...-->
    ```

- The methods `current_user.try(:admin?)` and `current_user` can be used to check if the user is signed in and is an Admin or a regular user, for further UI improvements (check the modified Index & Show Views for an example).

### Objective 6:

Disclaimer: This approach (specifically the JS function and HTML+ERB form) is not fully DRY due to issues I've run into with jQuery and Rails.

- To validate the title from the server-side (Model validation), add this line to the Complaint model:

	```ruby
	validates :title, presence: true
	```

- For client-side validation (View validation), first update `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` to include these three lines (before `//= require_tree .`)

	```ruby
	//= require jquery
	//= require jquery_ujs
	//= require bootstrap.min
	```

- Then, in that folder, create a new JavaScript file `inline_validation.js` with the following contents:

	```javascript
	function changeHandler() {
	  var complaint_title = $("#complaint_title").val();
	  var user_name = $("#user_name").val();
	  if (complaint_title || user_name ){
	      $("input[type=submit]").removeAttr("disabled");
	  } else {
	      $("input[type=submit]").attr("disabled", "disabled");
	  }
	}
	```

- Modify the form to match the following:

	```html
	<!--...-->
	<div class="field">
      <%= form.label :title %>
      <%= form.text_field :title, onkeyup: "changeHandler()" %>
  	</div>
  	<!--...-->
  	  <div class="actions">
      <%= form.submit id: "complaint_submit", disabled: "disabled" %>
  	</div>
  	<!--...-->
  	```

### Objective 7:

- Add the following field above the email field in `layouts/devise/new.html.erb` and `layouts/devise/edit.html.erb`:

	```html
	<div class="field">
      <%= f.label :name %><br />
      <%= f.text_field :name, autofocus: true %>
  	</div>
  	```

> Also remove the `autofocus` attribute from the email field.

- Generate the User registration controller by the following command:

	`rails generate devise:controllers users -c=registrations`

- Navigate to `controllers/users/registrations_controller.rb` and override the parameters to include a name by adding the following lines:

	```ruby
	def sign_up_params
      params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email, :password, :password_confirmation)
  	end
  	def account_update_params
      params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email, :password, :password_confirmation, :current_password)
  	end
  	```

- To use this new controller as the User registrations controller, add it as a route to routes.rb:

	`devise_for :users, controllers: { registrations: 'users/registrations' }`

- In the User model, to perform server-side validation, add the line

	`validates :name, presence: true`

- For client-side validation, modify the text fields and the submit button by following the proceedure outlined in Objective 6.
